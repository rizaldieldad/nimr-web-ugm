    "description": "A patient arrived at the hospital with severe fatigue and a non-healing foot ulcer. Information obtained from the family revealed that the patient had been living with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for more than five years. However, this critical information did not automatically appear in the system because it was not connected to the National Integrated Medical Record (NIMR). As a result, the clinical assessment had to be restarted from the beginning: blood glucose monitoring, wound evaluation, and treatment review. Some time earlier, the patient had also received antibiotics at another healthcare facility. Shortly after the medication was administered, the patient developed a severe allergic reaction. Further investigation showed that the allergy history had actually been recorded at another hospital, but it was not visible in the current system. The lack of integration delayed clinical processes, led to suboptimal therapeutic decisions, and caused inconsistencies in care across facilities.",
